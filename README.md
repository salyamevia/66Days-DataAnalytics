> **Day 1 of 66DaysOfData**

- **Big Query:** Using Google Cloud Big Query to understand the basics of data such as the table, fields, and how to list each item.
- **SQL:** Learned how to use `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`, and `ORDER BY`. I noticed the similarity between `WHERE` and `HAVING`. The clause `WHERE` works on every row on the table whereas the clause `HAVING` works for aggregated data generated by `GROUP BY`.

> **Day 2 of 66DaysOfData**

- **SQL**: Learned how to use `WITH...AS`, `LIKE`, and `JOIN` functions.
- **Tableau**: Experimented with the application. Still working on to do the Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) on Google Colab because I have prior experience with it.

> **Day 3 of 66DaysOfData**

- **SQL**: Learned how to use different types of `JOIN` functions and `UNION`. Both are quite similar in terms of usage, however the `JOIN` functions combine tables while `UNION` function combines queries.
